# Lab 01

# Introduction
This assignment will introduce you to the software and hardware development tools you will use during the semester to work with the STM32F429I-Discovery development board and the Cortex-M4 ARM Processor so that you may run programs using Keil Studio Cloud. The example code provided with this assignment shows you:

How to setup a project using Keil Studio
How to use timer interrupts to interface with the LEDs in the STM32F429-Discovery board using the "user push-button" on the board.


# Prelab
Reading: This lab combines elements from Chapters 1-6 of the course textbook. You should read and understand those chapters. Note that we will focus on C++ in this course, so you do not need to digest the sections on C or MicroPython. Pay specific attention to Chapter 5 (Interrupts and Power Management) and Chapter 6 (Timing Operations).

Hardware

STM32F429-Discovery
Mini-USB

The STM32F429-Discovery is powered via the mini-USB connection and no external power supply will be needed although this option is available. When using the mini-USB connection to power the board you must be very careful that any other peripherals that are using either the 3V or 5V output do not exceed 100mA otherwise you will burn the mini-USB interface on the board.

Setup Procedure

# Log in to Keil Studio Cloud

Connect your STM32F429-Discovery board to a USB port of your choice. Let Windows try to find the drivers. If the drivers are not found then the st-link usb drivers are missing and you will need assistance from the TAs.
Create new project called “MT2TA4-2024-Lab-01". Go to File -> New -> Mbed Project and select "empty Mbed OS project" from Example projects the dropdown. Name the project and uncheck "Initialize this project as a Git repository".
Set Active project to MT2TA4-2024-Lab-01
Set Build target to DISCO-F429ZI
Set Connected device to DISCO-F429ZI
Copy and paste the code from this lab's main.cpp file into main.cpp within your Keil Studio project.
Compile and Run the program using the run button: 


This will compile and download the project to the discovery board.
You should see LED4 (red) blink once per second. We call this phase 0 in the code. Pressing the user (blue) button will make LED4 (red) and LED3 (green) blink in a turn taking manner: LED4 on, LED4 off, LED3 on, LED3 off, and then repeat. This is phase 1. Pressing the user button a second time will switch to phase 2, which adds a 1-second period in which both LEDs are off between the blinking of LED4 and LED3. Additional button presses will switch between phase 1 and phase 2. As you can see from the code, this behaviour is achieved using a software-wait loop.

# Lab Requirements
Modify the demo code downloaded above to achieve the exact same behaviour using timer interrupts instead of software waits. The while loop in your main method should now be empty.

# Marking Scheme


40 pts A functional program that implements all the requirements correctly.

10 pts Motivate your design and implementation decisions to your TA and answer questions about your code.

3 pts main.cpp source file uploaded to your Avenue drop box for lab-01. In the event your project isn't fully functional, this may be used to justify partial marks.

Be prepared to demo the program you wrote to your TA in lab and also to defend your design and implementation decisions.
